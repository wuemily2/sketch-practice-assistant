# Sketch Practice Assistant
An app intended to replicate the functionality of websites like [Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/), but in desktop form and allowing users to select their own photos.

A simple wireframe has been created for the concept in Figma, see [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/KsqvHIprREEpnSY3ejOm1P/Sketching-Practice-Aid?node-id=1-28&starting-point-node-id=1%3A28&mode=design&t=2RGNBRtHmll5LizH-1). It is still recommended to check a site like [Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/) to understand intended functionality.

## Why make this app?
I can't find an equivalent app online that has the features I would like as a practicing artist, so I decided to develop this app on my own.

## Is this app completed yet?
So far, minimum functionality has been completed. 
What needs to be done next:
- Fix GUI to scale with screen size and implement styles with CSS
- Address todos scattered across files
- Add more robust error checking
- cleanup code
- (If possible) refactor code to be cleaner and more extensible

## What version of Java and JavaFX is used?
OpenJDK 21 and OpenJFX 21

## How would I set this up on my own computer and try to run it?
Coming soon...
